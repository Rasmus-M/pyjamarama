Welcome to the nightmare world of Wally Week.

Even Wallys have to sleep - the trouble is, being a Wally nightmares are
more troublesome than you would think.

Sweet dreams, Wally? NO CHANCE.

Being a Wally, nightmares are more common than pleasant dreams, and the
one you are entered is the worst ever. Not only are you still looking and
acting like a Wally you can't even sleep like normal people, and you are
having the Daddy of all nightmares.

OK Wally, don't you just lie there suffering in your nightmare do
something about it.

Well how would you normally wake yourself up? That's right, with an alarm
clock. No problem, or is it? Just find the clock, wind it up, and your
nightmare is over. Parts of your nightmare may repeat themselves, repeat
themselves, repeat themselves. Of course, being a nightmare and you being
a Wally things ain't gonna be that easy.

For a start everything suddenly seems larger than life, so even everyday
objects somehow present difficulties. And being a Wally, you may find it
even harder to release yourself from your predicament. Parts of your
nightmare may repeat themselves, repeat themselves, repeat themselves.

You may be totally incapable of working out what order to collect things,
use them, or even what you need to use. Can't help you there, Wally, but
if you want to wake up you've got to keep trying. Parts of your nightmare
may repeat themselves, repeat themselves, repeat themselves.

So straighten your cap, tighten your pyjama cord, slip into your slippers
and get moving.


Upon loading you are faced with a menu screen on which you will see:-

Key 1		Sinclair Joystick
Key 2		Kempston Joystick
Key 3		Define your own keys

The programme automatically sets

O-LEFT		P-RIGHT		M-JUMP

Wally really is in trouble this time. He has fallen asleep and in his
nightmare everything is enlarged to many times its normal size. To
release himself from torment he must find the alarm clock and wind it up.

This however is nowhere near as simple as it may sound because many
objects are needed to achieve different tasks which will become apparent
as the game progresses.

In many cases a particular object will be needed in order to collect or
use another one to satisfy a certain task. A seemingly impossible action
may merely require a different approach or object.

Only two objects can be carried at one time. To change an object, pass
over the one required and it will be exchanged automatically (to avoid
exchange, jump over the unwanted object).

There are many rooms in the house and a wide variety of "distractions" to
overcome. Keys will be required to open some doors, to open others, just
jump at the handle.

Even though you are asleep, energy is also a factor in this game. At the
top of the screen you will see a glass of milk with "Snooze Energy". A
short while after the start of the programme this will begin to decrease.
It will also decrease if you are hit by an object or you hit an object.
To replenish this lost energy there are items of food in the house, which
will appear singly, and in different locations. Once one has been
consumed the next will appear elsewhere, but always in its same location.
When your Snooze Energy has run out 3 times, losing 3 lives, you will
have to start the game again.

GENERAL FACTS
There are two different versions of Pyjamarama available.  The
main difference between them is the title music.  The music on
the *first* release is called "Popcorn", and quite commonly
available as a tracker/mod.  AFAIK there's no copyright
restriction on the Popcorn music.  The infinite lives hacks
were different for the different versions, so there must have
been something more than just the title music being changed.
